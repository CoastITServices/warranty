Description: 

	Looks up Apple warranty info based on serial number. Uses Apple's http://selfsolve.apple.com/warrantyChecker

	Based on a script by Scott Russell, IT Support Engineer, 
	University of Notre Dame
	http://www.nd.edu/~srussel2/macintosh/bash/warranty.txt

	Edited to add the ASD Versions by Joseph Chilcote

	Re-wrote by Rusty Myers for csv processing, plist and csv output.
	Edited 08/10/2011


Known Issue:

	Sometimes when processing bulk files, the script spits out one of the serial numbers as unkown and then prints tons of ASD numbers. 
	I'm usure why it does this because the serial usually works if run on a new csv or by itself.

Usage:

	Input:

		no flags = use this computers serial
		-b = loop through BULK csv file
			 processing a csv file will only output to a 
			 csv file. other output formats will be ignored
		-s = specify SERIAL number
		-h = print help

	Output:

		-f [csv|plist] = FORMAT output file to csv or plist.
		-o [/path/to/] = OUTPUT. Don't not include filename. Default is same directory as script.	
		-n [warranty.plist|.csv] = Speficiy output file NAME. Ensure you use the appropriate extension for your output.
	
	Defaults:

		WarrantyTempFile="/tmp/warranty.txt"
		AsdCheck="/tmp/asdcheck.txt"
		Output="."
		Format="stdout"

Examples:

	Default Use - Uses machine serial, prints to screen
	./warranty2.sh
	
	Specify Serial, prints to screen
	./warranty2.sh -s 4H632JhQXZ
	
	Specify Output format to Plist and save in specified output
	./warranty2.sh -f plist -o /Library/Admin/
	
	Specify Output format to Plist and save in specified output and a custom name
	./warranty2.sh -f plist -o ~/Desktop/ -n myserials.plist
	
	Process list of serials and output to custom location and custom name
	./warranty2.sh -b serials.csv -o ~/Desktop/ -n myserials.csv
