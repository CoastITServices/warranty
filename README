Known Issue:

	None	

Usage:

	Input:

		no flags = use this computers serial
		-b = loop through BULK csv file
			 processing a csv file will only output to a 
			 csv file. other output formats will be ignored
		-s = specify SERIAL number
		-h = print help

	Output:

		-f [csv|plist|DSProperties] = FORMAT output file to csv, plist, or DeployStudio format.
		-o [/path/to/] = OUTPUT. Don't not include filename. Default is same directory as script.	
		-n [warranty.plist|.csv] = Speficiy output file NAME. Ensure you use the appropriate extension for your output.
	
	Defaults:

		WarrantyTempFile="/tmp/warranty.txt"
		AsdCheck="/tmp/asdcheck.txt"
		Output="."
		Format="stdout"

Examples:

	Default Use - Uses machine serial, prints to screen
	./warranty2.sh
	
	Specify serial, prints to screen
	./warranty2.sh -s 4H632JhQXZ
	
	Specify output format to Plist and save in specified output
	./warranty2.sh -f plist -o /Library/Admin/
	
	Specify output format to Plist and save in specified output and a custom name
	./warranty2.sh -f plist -o ~/Desktop/ -n myserials.plist
	
	Process list of serials and output to custom location and custom name
	./warranty2.sh -b serials.csv -o ~/Desktop/ -n myserials.csv
	
	Print the output during DeployStudio workflow to enter into custom properties.

	./warranty2.sh -f DSProperties


To Do:

	Pull in the following...

	Hardware Image:
	null({"PROD_IMAGE_URL:https://km.support.apple.com.edgekey.net/kb/securedImage.jsp?configcode=YA8&size=72x72

	Number of days since purchase:
	NUM_DAYS_SINCE_DOP:1557
	
	Number of days remaining in coverage:
	DAYS_REM_IN_COV:180
	
	Serial is an iPhone
	IS_IPHONE:N
	
Resolved:

	P) Sometimes when processing bulk files, the script spits out one of the serial numbers as unkown and then prints tons of ASD numbers. 
	I'm usure why it does this because the serial usually works if run on a new csv or by itself.
	
	S) When running the script in twice, the asd and warranty temp files are overwritten by each process.
	The fix is to add a unique identifier to the filename. Each process will have it's own files.
